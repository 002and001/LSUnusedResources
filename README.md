# LSUnusedResources
A Mac App to find unused images and resources in a XCode project. It is heavily influenced by jeffhodnettâ€˜s [Unused](http://jeffhodnett.github.io/Unused/), but Unused is very very slow, and the results are not entirely correct. So I made some performance optimization, the search speed is more faster than Unused.

## Example

## Usage

It's an useful utility tool to check what resources are not being used in your Xcode projects. Very easy to use: 

1. Click `Browse..` to select a project folder.
2. Click `Search` to start searching.
3. Wait a second, the results will be shown in the tableview.

## Installation

* Download: [LSUnusedResources.app.zip](https://github.com/tinymind/LSUnusedResources/raw/master/Release/LSUnusedResources.app.zip)
* Or build and run the project using XCode.

## Requirements

Requires OS X 10.7 and above, ARC.
